After refactoring my original DTC program with the help of a GenAI tool, I identified several key improvements that made the code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

1. Better Code Structure and Formatting

In the original version, all code blocks were close together, making it hard to read.

The GenAI version uses clear sections for constructors, getters/setters, and behavior methods, along with proper spacing.

2. Const-Correctness

In the refactored code, all read-only functions like getters and printDTCInfo() are marked as const.

This ensures that these functions cannot modify class data accidentally.

3. Member Initialization Lists

The new version uses initialization lists in constructors.

This is a more efficient and modern C++ practice that directly initializes data members.

4. Improved Naming Conventions

Function names now follow consistent camelCase style.

For example, getActive() was replaced with isActive() which reads more naturally for boolean values.

5. Cleaner and More Informative Output

The display function now uses clear headers and aligned output for readability.

It’s easier to understand the diagnostic data when printed.

6. Safer String Passing

The refactored code uses const string& parameters to avoid unnecessary string copying, improving efficiency.

7. Logical Grouping of Code

Constructors, accessors, and behaviors are grouped logically with comment headers, making navigation simpler.

8. General Readability and Maintainability

The code is now formatted, documented, and consistent.

These improvements make it much easier to extend (for example, when adding new DTC attributes or methods in Task 3).

Summary:
The GenAI-refactored version follows modern C++ practices, improves efficiency with member initialization lists, adds safety through const usage, and significantly enhances readability through structure and documentation.
