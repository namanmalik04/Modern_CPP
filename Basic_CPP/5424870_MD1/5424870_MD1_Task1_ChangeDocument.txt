In this task, I refactored my original FleetVehicle program with the help of a GenAI tool. The following are the key changes made and the benefits I observed after refactoring:

1. Code Formatting and Readability

The original code had uneven indentation and spacing.

The GenAI version uses proper alignment, consistent indentation, and clear section separation.

This made the code much easier to read and navigate.

2. Improved Variable and Parameter Naming

Earlier, some variables were named generically (like id, dist, fuel).

In the refactored code, variable names are more descriptive such as distanceTravelled, fuelAmount, and vehicleID.

This improves clarity and self-documentation.

3. Added Structured Comments and Docstrings

The GenAI version includes meaningful comments before each function and class section.

This helps in quickly understanding the purpose of each part, which was missing earlier.

4. Enhanced Constructor Initialization

The refactored version uses member initializer lists in constructors instead of assignment inside the body.

This is a better C++ practice, as it ensures direct member initialization and slightly improves performance.

5. Const-Correctness and Safe References

Getter methods are now marked as const, ensuring they don’t modify class data accidentally.

References and const string& are used where applicable, avoiding unnecessary string copying.

6. Better Menu Display and Messages

The GenAI version uses cleaner console messages and formatting for better user readability.

Added section headers like “Fleet Vehicle Management” and “Vehicle Details.”

7. Error Handling Improvements

Exception handling messages are more informative and precise.

Refuel validation clearly explains invalid input.

8. General Code Modularity and Maintainability

The functions are grouped logically with comments: constructors, getters/setters, behaviors, and global utilities.

This modular approach makes it easy to maintain and extend the program in the future.

Summary:
Overall, the GenAI refactoring helped me make my code cleaner, more professional, and better structured. The readability, maintainability, and documentation have improved significantly without changing the program’s core logic or behavior.
